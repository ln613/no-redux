# no-redux

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ln613/no-redux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ln613/no-redux)

A react/redux library which automates all redux flows including http calls.

You define an object for each action with related information (e.g., url and http method), then call the corresponding action creator (generated by no-redux), and the http response or the payload will be put on the redux store. 

You don't have to write action creators, reducers, middlewares like thunks/sagas by yourself anymore everytime you create a new action, they are all generated automatically by no-redux, and store immutability is guaranteed. Redux becomes invisible to you, hence the name no-redux.

## Install

`npm i -S no-redux`

## Usage

**Step 1**

Define an action data object, and call "generateActions" to generate action creators.

```js
import { generateActions } from 'no-redux';

export const actionData = {
  artists: {
    url: 'http://localhost/api/artists'
  }
}

export default generateActions(actionData);
```

**Step 2**

Create a redux store by calling the "createStore" function from "no-redux" with the action data object you defined in step 1. The "createStore" function will generate reducers and middlewares that handles http calls and register them with the redux store.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { Provider, createStore } from 'no-redux';
import { actionData } from './actions';
import App from './App';

render(
  <Provider store={createStore(actionData)}>
    <App />  
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

**Step 3**

In your component, connect to the store with the action creators you created in step 1. When you call the action creator functions, no-redux will generate the actions, make http requests, get the http response and put the results on the redux store.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'no-redux';
import actions from './actions';

class App extends React.Component {
  componentWillMount() {
    this.props.getArtists();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {(this.props.artists || []).map(a => 
          <div>{a.name}</div>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default connect(s => ({ artists: s.artists }), actions)(App);
```
