# no-redux

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ln613/no-redux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ln613/no-redux)

A react/redux library which automates all redux flows including http calls.

You define an object for each action with related information (e.g., url and http method), then call the corresponding action creator (generated by no-redux), and the http response or the payload will be put on the redux store. 

You don't have to write action creators, reducers, middlewares like thunks/sagas by yourself anymore everytime you create a new action, they are all generated automatically by no-redux, and store immutability is guaranteed. Redux becomes invisible to you, hence the name no-redux.
