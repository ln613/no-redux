# no-redux

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ln613/no-redux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ln613/no-redux)

A react/redux library which automates all redux flows including http calls. No more action creators, reducers, thunks/sagas..., and immutability is guaranteed. Redux becomes invisible to you, hence the name no-redux.
